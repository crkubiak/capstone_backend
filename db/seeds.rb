# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# r1 = Record.create(location: "Chicago", comment: "Cats Cats Cats")

# Image.create(image_url: "https://cdn01.vulcanpost.com/wp-uploads/2017/04/cat-games-feature-image-1.png", records_id: r1.id)
